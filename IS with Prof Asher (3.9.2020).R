#TITLE OF STUDY: Roads and Networks of Urban Governance in Rural India
-Role of roads: As one of the variables
-Innovation and Diffusion of Urban Governance best practice
#Are there leaders in governance best practice? Diffusion of experience?
#Networks and nodes of governance
#Multiple tests of subsets based on different radiuses and "connections". Bootstrapping? How do variances of certain
#quantitative variables change? Imply different distributions in different regions?
#Movement of chiefs.
#Latent variables and ommited variables?
#Heterogeneity of Sub-Groups of census towns across regions.

#Are there governance issues in urban/regional transportation?
#What innovations are there in local governance structures with regards to transport? Public-private partnerships?
#Managerialism vs. Entrepreneurialism in this area?
A basic application of transport theory to "poverty transportation" in India.
#Building on "Rural Roads and Structural Transformation"
#Optimal Efficiency of roads?
#Underestimated network effect of roads leading to census towns.

#Governance Topics
#Merging of state institutions. How to isolate and identify its impact.
#Change in legislative borders. Impact on local economic activity
#Increased/decreased local autonomy and impact on public goods/service delivery
#SOE/Public enterprise vacuum in census towns. What local institutions fill that vacuum? How do they fare?
#Specifically energy utilities.
#Is fragmentation within and across census towns a result of governance?
#The electoral process.
#Accountability in Census Towns
#Inadequate political representation? Of different actors in census towns?
##(From PPT) Spatial dimension â€“ how far to decentralize? How to link different scale levels? Within city and outside?

#USE: Ancillary dataset.

#Pseudo-code: Using shrids, identify subset of villages/towns that have two neighboring village/towns within 30km and all three
#village/towns are 50km or farther from cities (larger habitations)
#If: 
#Else: Drop
#Store as ___

#Pseudo-code: Create array. For each village/town, list first and second nearest towns/villages

#GOOGLE API
#https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mapsapi/vignettes/intro.html

#Pseudo-code: Using Google Maps API, identify shortest route for each village/town combination in the above array

#Pseudo-code: Pull data on roads and find current lassification of roads.
#This could be the most difficult part. Many routes might not have matching records in the road database.

#Pseudo-code: Use historic data to create panel of road classification (illustrating how they've changed)

#Pseudo-code: Use satellite imagery to determine formal vs. informal roads.

###This allows us to render the "road variable" as an outcome variable.
